## Setup and Installation

To set up and run the code in this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/fcc-data-analysis-with-python.git](https://github.com/your-username/fcc-data-analysis-with-python.git)
    cd fcc-data-analysis-with-python
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.)*

2.  **Install dependencies (for the main projects):**
    The core projects (in the `Projects/` directory) have their dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    cd Projects
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd .. # Go back to the root if you want to explore other folders
    ```
    *Note: It is highly recommended to use a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to manage dependencies.*
