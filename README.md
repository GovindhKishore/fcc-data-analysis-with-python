# FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python

Compiling my work for the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification, this repository includes completed projects and supplementary learning resources. It should be noted that certain learning materials, specifically Jupyter Notebooks within designated folders (notebooks), are direct extractions from the FreeCodeCamp course content, used herein for educational demonstration and appropriate citation.

## Projects

This directory (`Projects/`) contains the main certification projects required by FreeCodeCamp. Each project addresses a specific data analysis challenge, demonstrating skills in data manipulation, visualization, and statistical computation.

* **[Access Projects README here for details](Projects/README.md)**

    * Demographic Data Analyzer
    * Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
    * Page View Time Series Visualizer

## Learning Resources / Notebooks

This section holds various materials used for learning and practising data analysis concepts.

* **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks related to the topics mentioned below, which are directly extracted from the Data Analysis with Python FCC Course.
* **`JupyterNotebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks used for exploration, learning, and demonstrations of data analysis concepts.
* **`NumPy/`**: Exercises and examples specifically focused on the NumPy library.
* **`Pandas/`**: Exercises and examples specifically focused on the Pandas library.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run the code in this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/GovindhKishore/fcc-data-analysis-with-python.git](https://github.com/GovindhKishore/fcc-data-analysis-with-python.git)
    cd fcc-data-analysis-with-python
    ```
    

2.  **Install dependencies (for the main projects):**
    The core projects (in the `Projects/` directory) have their dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    cd Projects
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd .. # Go back to the root if you want to explore other folders
    ```
    *Note: It is highly recommended to use a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to manage dependencies.*
